Aim of the project is to make computer interaction more human centered.

The application uses OpenCV, JavaCV and Tesseract OCR. The application can read alphabetic based gestures via webcam and process it and open appropriate application as specified in the database. If the gesture is not found, user is queryied for the details which it will record in the database and use in the future hence expanding its capability.

The Path for the Application to launch should be provided as the Code to exe. 

NB : System is designed for Windows OS and havent tested in other Operating Systems.
